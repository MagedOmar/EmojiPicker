## Installation
Ready for use on iOS 12+

### Swift Package Manager
The [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.
```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/izzyumkin/EmojiPicker", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

### Manually
If you prefer not to use any of dependency managers, you can integrate manually. Put `Sources/EmojiPicker` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.
